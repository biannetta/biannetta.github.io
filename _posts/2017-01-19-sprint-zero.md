The purpose of this blog is to keep record of the modernization process going on at my company. This first post, post zero, is to provide background and context to the remainder of this blog

* Small company, limited in resources

The layout of this blog will follow along with the style of agile project management. I will post after each completed sprint all the things I have learned and how we have progressed from the previous sprint. Sprints will probably last about 3 to 4 weeks.
